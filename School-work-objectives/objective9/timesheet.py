"""
Write a subroutine that asks the user for a date in the format dd/mm and hours worked. These details are recorded in a set of serial files, one for each month. New data is appended to the correct file. E.g. if the user enters 22/04 and 5, the file called April.txt will have the number 5 added to it.
Write another subroutine that takes a month as a parameter and outputs the total hours for that month.
